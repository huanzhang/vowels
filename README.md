# vowels

## MOVING VOWELS
The sounds at the left are all moving vowels (tense vowels, diphthongs, and glides). That is, the jaw and/or tongue move from one position to another in order to produce these vowel sounds. The “y” and “w” featured in the Chart indicate the direction of the movement in these vowel sounds.

* iː
* eɪ
* aɪ
* oʊ
* uː
* aʊ
* ɔɪ

## NON-MOVING VOWELS
These are all non-moving (still) vowels (lax vowels and monophthongs). That is, each sound is produced with a single non-moving tongue-jaw position.
* ɪ
* e
* æ
* ɑː
* ɔː
* ʌ
* ə
* ɜːr
* ʊ
