# vowels

## MOVING VOWELS
The sounds at the left are all moving vowels (tense vowels, diphthongs, and glides). That is, the jaw and/or tongue move from one position to another in order to produce these vowel sounds. The “y” and “w” featured in the Chart indicate the direction of the movement in these vowel sounds.

* iː green tea
* eɪ gray day
* aɪ white tie
* oʊ rose coat
* uː blue moon
* aʊ brown cow
* ɔɪ turquoise toy

## NON-MOVING VOWELS
These are all non-moving (still) vowels (lax vowels and monophthongs). That is, each sound is produced with a single non-moving tongue-jaw position.
* ɪ silver pin
* e red dress
* æ black cat
* ɑː olive sock
* ɔː auburn dog
* ʌ, ə a cup of mustard
* ɜːr purple shirt
* ʊ wooden hook
